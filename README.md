### What I learned

I have been primarily working on back-end hardware facing development using C# and other technologies in my day job for the past two years, so I'm a bit rusty on my fullstack skills, especially my Front-End CSS development. I plan on using Front End Mentor as a way to sharpen my skills back up to the level they were at around two years ago. I used this challenge as a way to work on mobile-first development. Funnily enough, I encountered the same problem I always used to have, how to center the content in the middle of the page!
Please let me know about anything you think that could be improved, I'm here to get better, so your feedback is welcome!

### Continued development

I'd like ton continue working on Flexbox, and CSS grid in the future. I used to use these technologies a lot, but I haven't recently, so I'd like to get back up to speed.

### Useful resources
